# PresentR
A project created at DeltaHacks 9 at McMaster University

PresentR is a PyQt6 application that allows a user to record audio and video, start a timer, and export the audio transcript to a PDF file. The application creates a main window with several buttons, including a "Record Audio" button, a "Record Video" button, a "Start Timer" button, a "Generate Report" button, and an "Export to PDF" button. These allow the user to either record audio or video and generate an analysis for their presentation skills, which will use Machine Learning models such as Whisper AI, and GingerIt for grammar and spelling parsing. The application also uses other libraries such as OpenCV, PyAudio, and PyQt6.
